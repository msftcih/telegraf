# Configuration for Event Hubs output plugin
[[outputs.event_hubs]]
  ## Authentication Method
  ## Option 1: Use connection string (traditional method)
  ## Full connection string to the Event Hub instance. The shared access key
  ## must have "Send" permissions on the target Event Hub.
  connection_string = "Endpoint=sb://namespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=superSecret1234=;EntityPath=hubName"

  ## Option 2: Use Azure Managed Identity (recommended for Azure resources)
  ## Set use_managed_identity = true and provide eventhub_namespace and eventhub_name
  ## This supports both traditional Managed Identity (VMs) and Workload Identity (AKS pods)
  # use_managed_identity = false
  
  ## Event Hub namespace (required when using managed identity)
  ## This can be just the namespace name (e.g., "mynamespace") or the full FQDN (e.g., "mynamespace.servicebus.windows.net")
  # eventhub_namespace = "mynamespace"
  
  ## Event Hub name (required when using managed identity)  
  # eventhub_name = "myhub"
  
  ## Managed Identity Client ID (optional)
  ## Leave empty to use system-assigned managed identity
  ## Provide client ID to use user-assigned managed identity
  ## For Workload Identity in AKS, this can also be set via AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable
  # managed_identity_id = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"

  ## Partition key to use for the event
  ## Metric tag or field name to use for the event partition key. The value of
  ## this tag or field is set as the key for events if it exists. If both, tag
  ## and field, exist the tag is preferred.
  # partition_key = ""

  ## Set the maximum batch message size in bytes
  ## The allowable size depends on the Event Hub tier, see
  ##   https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quotas#basic-vs-standard-vs-premium-vs-dedicated-tiers
  ## for details. If unset the default size defined by Azure Event Hubs is
  ## used (currently 1,000,000 bytes)
  # max_message_size = "1MB"

  ## Timeout for sending the data
  # timeout = "30s"

  ## Data format to output.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
  data_format = "json"
